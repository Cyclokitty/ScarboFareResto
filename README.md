Scarborough Fare Restaurant
==============================

Taking my [Scarborough Fare](https://cyclokitty.github.io/ScarboroughFare/) page written in javascript and jquery and coding it in React.



## Creation Notes:
### Using [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

### Added Sass

### Erased all kinds of React stuff (like the favicon and the logo)

### Just duplicate the entire folder and begin your React project.
